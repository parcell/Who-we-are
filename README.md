# Who-we-are
Leveraging  Technology to Enhance Processes

The Parcell team is curious. We're the kind of people who want to know more about the mundane, because it is interesting to us. We like talking to workers, whether on the flight line or factory floor. This curiosity is what gives us a deeper understanding of the challenges, paint points, and problem sets of our customers.â€‹

We're also resourceful. Our users are often hobbled with budget shortages, technology restrictions, and other issues. We know how to work within this environment to deliver the solutions that will meet their needs.
